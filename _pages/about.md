# Hello, stranger!
Nice to see you here. Here I plan to share my research, teachning experience, and everything else that I find fascinating. I will be happy if you find something interesting or useful here.  

# About myself
I am fascinated by physics and how math helps us to describe and understand physical phenomena in its elegant way. Now, my interest lies in the field of nonlinear dynamics. In the [lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/), where I do my PhD, I study nonlinear dynamics of dissipative Kerr solitons (special type of optical waves that self-organize thanks to the dispersion and nonlinearity) in small optical resonators. With my collegue, Alexey Tikan, we develop an open-source software [PyCORe](https://github.com/ElKosto/PyCORe) for simulating this dynamics in arrays of coupled resonators. I equally enjoy teaching and public outreach of my research, so if you have any questions about physics or math, you are always welcome to drop me a message.


Aside from science, I also play bass in our band \emph{Diable Rabattable}. Check us out on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP-yRxC9Ahc-A2kceefwP0Q) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/diablerabattable/).
