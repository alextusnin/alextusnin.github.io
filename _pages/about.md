Nice to see you here. Here I plan to share my research, teaching experiences, and anything else I find fascinating. I will be happy if you find something interesting or useful here.  

# About myself
I am fascinated by physics and how mathematics helps us to describe and understand physical phenomena in an elegant way. Now my interest lies in the field of nonlinear dynamics. In the [lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/), where I am doing my Ph.D., I study the nonlinear dynamics of dissipative Kerr solitons (a special type of optical wave that self-organizes due to the balance between dispersion and nonlinearity) in small optical resonators. With my colleague Alexey Tikan, we are developing an open-source software [PyCORe](https://alextusnin.github.io/PyCORe_pages/_pages/intro.html) to simulate this dynamics in arrays of coupled resonators.  I also enjoy teaching and communicating my research to the public, so if you have any questions about physics or mathematics, feel free to drop me a line.


Besides science, I also play bass in our band *Diable Rabattable*. Check us out on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP-yRxC9Ahc-A2kceefwP0Q) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/diablerabattable/).
