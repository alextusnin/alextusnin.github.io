I became really passionate about physics during my first year at Novosibirsk State University (NSU) in Akademgorodok (Novosibirsk). It was a perfect place for me to start exploring the world of science: I was waking up in the morning, attending the courses given by the real scientists from the institutes nearby. They were always capable to relate the exercises from the class to the actual problems that they encounter in their labs.
